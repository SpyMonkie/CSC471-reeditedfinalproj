For Final Program, I have implemented the following features:
1. I am using the GCC 12.2.0 x86_64-w64-mingw32 (ucrt64) compiler
2. TO build the program:
    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake ..
    - cmake --build .
3. I have implemented the following features:
    - It does take a little to load the scene
    - when scene is loaded, press 'Space' to start the animation
    - you can look around with the touchpad scroll and move with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D'
    - once in the next scene, you can also press 'G' to start the other animation
    - cannot move until the animation is done, can also repress 'G' to restart the tron animation
    - press 'R' to reset everything - and 'space' to start the beginning animation again
